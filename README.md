## Interactables as alternative for medicine

### Introduction 

The ETZ is a large hospital in the city of Tilburg. Its Oncology department treats patients that are 
diagnosed with a large number of different types of cancer. Treatment differs from patient to patient, 
but for some forms of treatments patients have to spend several days to even weeks in hospital. 
Sometimes even in complete isolation to prevent infections. 
Kanker.nl is the largest Dutch community for people that suffer from, have suffered from or have a near 
one suffering from cancer.  Its aim is to improve the quality of life for all these people by providing good 
quality information on the topic and supporting a large community that can share their experiences with 
each other.  
A cancer diagnosis and the treatment often brings a lot of stress, uncertainty and fear for the future. In 
most cases either the cancer itself or the treatment can result in pain. Hospitalization itself can also lead 
to more stress or homesickness or (in case of isolation) loneliness. These are all very undesirable effects 
that have a negative effect on the healing process. Also in the period after hospitalization, back at home, 
the same problems often occur. 
As a remedy often regular medication is used to suppress the feelings mentioned above. However, these 
medicine also come with undesirable side effects. Therefore, as an alternative, the ETZ has 
experimented with a VR headset with 360-degree video content (for example of relaxing nature scenes), 
games and relaxation exercises (like breathing exercises or meditation). The results of the experiment 
were very positive and the VR headset is now available for all patients. 

### Problem statement

The problem is that not all the patients want to use a VR headset in the hospital because of these reasons:

- The patient gets dizzy or nausea
- The patient doesn't like the idea of putting a VR headset on because its strange or nerdy
- The patient doesn't want to ask for a headset because he/she thinks the nurses are too busy
- Lastly the VR headset costs alot of money so it's not available for all the patients at home

### Design challenge

Build a prototype of an installation or a program that aims at the same way of solving issues like pain, 
stress and loneliness like the VR headset, but that solves one of the issues mentioned in the problem 
statement. You may think broadly and are not limited to the current configuration of a VR headset, but 
are explicitly invited to come up with alternatives.
You are allowed to focus your solution on the period during hospitalization, the period at home or both. 

### Mindmap

This is a mindmap about the 2 ideas we came up with. After we brainstormed some more we made the choice to go for soundify, because that idea is available anytime.

### Technology's

For the technologies we will be using: 

Flutter or React native
- Flutter: The reason why we will be using flutter is because we can make a good mobile (phone and tablet) application in one go. This also saves alot of time in general because this framework is cross platform. This way we can create 1 app for Android and IOS. 
- React native
  - Easier to learn
  - Takes less time to program
  - Is used by big companies
  - Developing in JavaScript
 
# Solution

Our solution to this problem is Soundify, Soundify is a mobile application where users can listen to music, podcasts and audiobooks. For this solution there are only a few things needed. A mobile phone and audio output (preferably headphones). The user interface is easy to use for non-technical people. Also the application can be accessed from anywhere so that means at home or in the hospital.

### POC design

This is the first design we made regarding the poc. The design is made for a tablet and shows the ideas we have for the application.

### Prototype design

These are the designs for the official prototype on mobile. below are all the features:

- Listen to music
- Listen to audio books
- Listen to podcasts
- Create a party to listen together

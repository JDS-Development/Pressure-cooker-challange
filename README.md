## Interactables as alternative for medicine

### Introduction 

The ETZ is a large hospital in the city of Tilburg. Its Oncology department treats patients that are 
diagnosed with a large number of different types of cancer. Treatment differs from patient to patient, 
but for some forms of treatments patients have to spend several days to even weeks in hospital. 
Sometimes even in complete isolation to prevent infections. 
Kanker.nl is the largest Dutch community for people that suffer from, have suffered from or have a near 
one suffering from cancer.  Its aim is to improve the quality of life for all these people by providing good 
quality information on the topic and supporting a large community that can share their experiences with 
each other.  
A cancer diagnosis and the treatment often brings a lot of stress, uncertainty and fear for the future. In 
most cases either the cancer itself or the treatment can result in pain. Hospitalization itself can also lead 
to more stress or homesickness or (in case of isolation) loneliness. These are all very undesirable effects 
that have a negative effect on the healing process. Also in the period after hospitalization, back at home, 
the same problems often occur. 
As a remedy often regular medication is used to suppress the feelings mentioned above. However, these 
medicine also come with undesirable side effects. Therefore, as an alternative, the ETZ has 
experimented with a VR headset with 360-degree video content (for example of relaxing nature scenes), 
games and relaxation exercises (like breathing exercises or meditation). The results of the experiment 
were very positive and the VR headset is now available for all patients. 

### Problem statement

The problem however is that in many cases the VR headset is not applied. The main reasons are:
- The patient has a contra indication that makes the use of the VR headset not safe (for example 
dizziness or nausea) 
- The patient simply dislikes the idea of putting on VR glasses (it is strange, to technical/nerdy, ...)
- The patient feels a threshold to ask for the VR glasses because he/she sees that the nurses are 
very busy with the other jobs (and the VR glasses are not seen as regular care but ‘an extra’). 
Besides this, the VR headset is rather costly and therefore not available for many patients at home. 


### Design challenge

Build a prototype of an installation or a program that aims at the same way of solving issues like pain, 
stress and loneliness like the VR headset, but that solves one of the issues mentioned in the problem 
statement. You may think broadly and are not limited to the current configuration of a VR headset, but 
are explicitly invited to come up with alternatives.
You are allowed to focus your solution on the period during hospitalization, the period at home or both.
